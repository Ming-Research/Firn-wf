## 2026-10-06 firn builds with a pinned release through Whitefoot-kit

Nodes: firn/building

Owner-approved: In the Firn session of 2026-10-05 and 2026-10-06, written in Chinese: Q44 B, a downstream downloads a published compiler; Q51, releases made on request and pinned by name, refined by the owner to compiled releases, never a Whitefoot submodule ("downstream uses the compiled release, not a submodule", translated); Q54 A, the shared rules kept in one repository taken as a submodule ("Q54 picks A"); Q55, its name Whitefoot-kit ("Q55 as recommended").

Summary: firn builds with the Whitefoot compiler release `whitefoot.pin` names by commit, a revision bound for main naming a release of a commit on Whitefoot's main, instead of a Whitefoot submodule or a specification-version pin, and takes the pin's checks, the download and the upgrade rules from the shared `whitefoot-kit` submodule, instead of a copy per project; shipping the shared rules in each release is refused because the downloader cannot come from what it downloads.

## 2026-10-06 Redis's own suite gates firn as a ratchet

Nodes: firn

Owner-approved: Q53 A, in the Firn session of 2026-10-06, written in Chinese: "52 53 both agreed" (translated), to the proposal that Redis 7.0.15's test suite run in every push's gate as a ratchet of the tests firn passes.

Summary: `design/firn.md` gains the decision that Redis 7.0.15's own suite gates firn as a ratchet of named passing tests, run without tolerating the framework's errors, so a lost pass fails the gate even when another test starts passing, instead of an aggregate count or a whole-suite requirement; repeated CI runs establish the passing set and tests passing only sometimes are listed apart with their frequency.

## 2026-10-06 Command parts, scripts' commands and the append-only file's blocks and cut

Nodes: firn/command-parts, firn/scripts, firn/append-only-file

Owner-approved: Approved in the firn session of Whitefoot PR #245 (2026-10-05) as the scripting groundwork plan S1-S6, its follow-ups 1-5, and rulings Q39 and Q40, and Q42 A in the Firn session of 2026-10-05, written in Chinese, where the owner answered "OK" to the proposal that Q41 and Q42 go with option A; Whitefoot PR #245's description records the first set, and lists Q42 as open because it predates that answer. Its code moved here as Firn-wf #3. The decision that a file that does not load stops firn is Q56 A, which the review of Firn-wf #3 raised, approved in the Firn session of 2026-10-06, written in Chinese: "agree".

Summary: A command is four parts, parsing, a body over its key's entry, a metadata step and a reply, shared by the network path and `script_command` (S5, follow-up 1). Scripts refuse Redis's noscript commands and answer a command not yet split with Redis's unknown-command text plus a firn note, instead of a second name table (S4, Q42 A). A script's commands see the clock as it was when the script began (S2); a key a script finds expired is removed at once with its `DEL` in the effects (follow-up 2); the caller wraps more than one appended record in `MULTI`/`EXEC` (Q39). Replay applies a block only once its `EXEC` is read (S3), and a file whose end did not load is cut as Redis cuts it, with `std::fs::truncate_file` (Q40). A file that does not load, a malformed record, a failed read or a block past the input window's ceiling, stops firn with status 4 before it listens, as Redis 7.0.15 exits, instead of serving part of the file (Q56 A).

## 2026-10-06 The firn tree moves here from Whitefoot

Nodes: firn

Owner-approved: Both decisions were approved in the Whitefoot session of 2026-10-03 as Q1 (complete standalone application workloads) and Q2 (a Lua interpreter written in Whitefoot, beginning with a vertical slice), recorded in Whitefoot's `design/log.md` entry "Firn's standalone deployment and Whitefoot Lua direction" ([Whitefoot at 648338c31](https://github.com/Ming-Research/Whitefoot/blob/648338c31240ba64ce13c314b1afca1749d44189/design/log.md)). The move itself follows the owner's ruling Q43, that firn leaves Whitefoot for this repository. In the session of 2026-10-06, written in Chinese, translated: "Decision 1 is right", and of decision 2: "I approved this long ago, otherwise Halo would not have been written up to now".

Summary: Whitefoot's node `language/firn` becomes this repository's root node `firn` (`design/firn.md`) with its two decisions unchanged: firn's first public deployment milestone is complete standalone Redis application workloads with existing clients and unchanged business logic, and its scripting milestone a Lua interpreter written in Whitefoot, tested first through a vertical slice against Redis's interpreter. Only the links to the deployment direction changed, to `research/investigations/firn/DESIGN.md` in this repository.

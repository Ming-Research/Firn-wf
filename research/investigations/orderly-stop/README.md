# Orderly stop

## The question

Redis 7.0.15's `SHUTDOWN`, and its handling of SIGTERM and SIGINT, append and
sync the append-only file, close every client and end the server at once.
firn ends only when its entry returns, and Whitefoot's spawns are structured:
the entry joins every context it started, so every client's context, the
accept loop and the writers must reach their end first
([kernel specification v0.94, WAIT-3's join rules](https://github.com/Ming-Research/Whitefoot/blob/0b7f5c5b98547dd27deb9691aed36281e350576b/spec/kernel-spec.md)).
A context waiting in `tcp_accept`, `receive_next` or `send_once` with no
deadline waits until the host produces an outcome, and v0.94 has no way to
cancel such a wait from another context. A stop request can therefore reach
every context in one of two ways:

- **Polling.** Every wait carries a deadline of at most a second, and each
  context reads the keyspace's `stopping` when its wait ends. `serve`
  (`firn/server/server.wf`) already does this while an idle limit is set.
- **A Whitefoot capability.** The language or its library lets a stop end
  the waits of other contexts, or lets the program end without joining them
  once its files are synced.

Polling needs no Whitefoot change. Its cost is a monotonic clock read and a
timer armed and removed on every receive that parks, which in an unpipelined
request and reply is every request (`wf_context_arm_deadline` in Whitefoot's
`compiler/src/backend/completion/bridge.c`). The question is whether that
cost is measurable on firn's throughput.

## The comparison, stated before measuring

- Workload: `redis-bench.yml` mode compare on the i9-14900K. Revisions:
  - `base`, Firn-wf main 936110104;
  - `head`, the same with a receive deadline of at most a second armed
    whether or not an idle limit is set;
  - `head-twin`, head's image again, as the noise control.
- Tests `set` and `get` at pipeline depths 1 and 16, on 1 and 2 server CPUs.
  A probe of 2 passes of 5 seconds sizes the run; the decision rests on the
  sized run.
- **Rejection rule.** Polling is rejected if head's median rate at depth 1,
  for either test on either CPU count, is lower than base's by more than 2%
  and by more than the difference between head and head-twin there. The
  alternative is then to ask Whitefoot for the capability above. Depth 16
  is reported, not decided on, since a deep pipeline parks once per batch.

## Results

**Probe.** Run [37570894247](https://github.com/Ming-Research/Firn-wf/actions/runs/37570894247)
compared base 936110104, head 54268619b (branch `claude/stop-poll-probe`)
and head-twin. It ran 2 passes of 5 seconds. Each cell is the median rate,
and the last column is the difference between head and head-twin:

| depth | CPUs | test | base | head | head / base | head and twin |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | set | 147k | 152k | +3.3% | 1.0% |
| 1 | 1 | get | 155k | 152k | -2.3% | 2.9% |
| 1 | 2 | set | 264k | 263k | -0.4% | 2.5% |
| 1 | 2 | get | 272k | 278k | +2.2% | 3.1% |
| 16 | 1 | set | 1751k | 1804k | +3.0% | 3.7% |
| 16 | 1 | get | 1931k | 1892k | -2.0% | 1.8% |
| 16 | 2 | set | 3137k | 3181k | +1.4% | 2.4% |
| 16 | 2 | get | 3361k | 3469k | +3.2% | 5.7% |

At this resolution, about 3%, the probe shows no cost. That is too coarse
for the 2% rule. The sized run takes depth 1 alone, 6 passes of 10 seconds
on 1 and 2 CPUs.

**Sized run.** Run [37573701622](https://github.com/Ming-Research/Firn-wf/actions/runs/37573701622)
compared the same images at depth 1, 6 passes of 10 seconds each. head's
only change from base was the receive deadline that the implementation on
this branch also makes: in `serve`, the deadline of at most a second is
computed whether or not an idle limit is set. Each cell is the median rate;
the next columns give the server's processor time per request:

| CPUs | test | base | head | head-twin | head / base | head and twin | base µs | head µs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | set | 152.1k | 150.2k | 151.0k | -1.25% | 0.51% | 6.56 | 6.65 |
| 1 | get | 154.0k | 153.3k | 154.3k | -0.45% | 0.63% | 6.49 | 6.52 |
| 2 | set | 259.7k | 265.9k | 269.1k | +2.36% | 1.21% | 7.67 | 7.51 |
| 2 | get | 268.9k | 267.3k | 271.9k | -0.59% | 1.71% | 7.43 | 7.47 |

**Decision under the rule.** No test on either CPU count loses more than
2%, so polling is not rejected.

**What remains uncertain.** On one CPU, `set` loses 1.25%, more than the
0.51% between head and its twin, and its processor time per request rises
by 1.2%. A cost of about 1% on unpipelined writes on one CPU is therefore
not excluded; it lies below the rule's threshold. The rule weighs nothing at
depth 16, where a batch parks once.
